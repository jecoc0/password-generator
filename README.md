# Password Generator


## Description

```
- Motivation: I wanted to create a Password Generator 
- I built this project so I could easily generate a password that met certain criteria.
- This project solves the problem of being unable to come up with random complex passwords on a regular basis.
- I learned about multiple array methods, and using logic elements in order to create passwords that meet specific criteria.
